    <h1>HAIJING LIU'S BIG DATA SPACE</h1>
    <p>This is Haijing's space for the big data course. I studied architecture before and have worked as an architectural designer before coming to MIT. Right now I'm a first year MCP student. I'm super excited about the course! Below is a project I find inspiring. You can find more details <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/40339307/The-Metabolism-of-Albania"> here</a>.  </p>
