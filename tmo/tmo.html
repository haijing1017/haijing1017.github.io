        <h1>Neighborhood Vulnerability and Displacement Risks <br>in Texas Metropolitan Regions</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The analysis presented in these maps examines patterns of vulnerability and neighborhood change in the 25 metropolitan regions (MSAs) in Texas. Metropolitan regions are the dominant nexus of economic activity and population in the state. The ways these regions are growing and changing strongly shape socioeconomic, environmental and health outcomes now and into the future.</p>
        <p>This work examines patterns of neighborhood change in Texas metros over the 2000-2018 period.   The maps portray important socio-demographic characteristics and patterns of change at the census tract level within Texas MSAs. The key measures and methods for this analysis were drawn from the literature on neighborhood vulnerability and neighborhood change, especially <i>Uprooted: Residential Displacement in Austin’s Gentrifying Neighborhoods and What Can Be Done About It (Way, Mueller, and Wegmann, 2018).</i></p>
        <br>
        <h3>Vulnerability Measure</h3>
        <p>The first key measure developed is a vulnerability index for each census tract in the Texas MSAs.  The vulnerability index registers demographic and socioeconomic factors in a neighborhood (or census tract) that may make it more vulnerable to a range of factors including displacement due to rising housing costs, environmental shocks (such as flooding) and public health challenges (such as COVID-19). The vulnerability index was constructed from a short list of indicators that researchers have identified as making communities more susceptible to housing cost increases and other changes or shocks. As Way et al. state, “Social vulnerability refers to the differing ability of members of particular socio-demographic groups to withstand threats to their livelihoods, security, and social, economic and political networks.” (Way, Mueller and Wegmann, 2018, p. 19).</p>
        <p>The vulnerability index for each census tract is constructed from five variables: </p>
        <p>1) <b>Race and ethnicity</b> - defined as the percent of residents who identify as anything other than non-Hispanic/Latino, White alone; </p>
        <p>2) <b>Lower levels of educational attainment</b> - defined as percent of residents 25 or over who do not have a bachelors degree of higher; </p>
        <p>3) <b>Low income</b> - defined as percent of households in census tract with below 80% of area median family income (in the MSA); </p>
        <p>4) <b>Renters</b> - defined as the percent of households who rent rather than own their homes; </p>
        <p>5) <b>Children in poverty</b> - defined as the share of young people who live in households with income below the poverty line.</p>  
        <p>Census tracts within the 25 MSAs were considered vulnerable if at least three of the five variables above had significantly higher values than the average in the given MSA. The significance of the tract difference was estimated with a Z-score. If the Z-score for at least three of the above variables exceeded +0.5 the tract was designated as vulnerable.</p>
        <p>In the maps of each MSA, vulnerable census tracts in 2000 are shown in dark blue. Vulnerable tracts in 2018 are designated in light green. Tracts that had high vulnerability scores for both 2000 and 2018 are shown in dark green.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Displacement Risk Measures</h3>
        <p>When looking over time at overall metro population change in Texas MSAs, there has been a significant suburbanization trend as the urban share of total metro population fell from 66 percent in 1990 to 59 percent by 2015. The suburban population share increased by 7.2 percent over the period, equaling 41 percent of the total metro population by 2015. However, in select metro areas the share of population growth in urban areas of MSAs exceeded suburban growth over the 2010-2015 period   This recent  change in urban-suburban growth patterns is consistent with a national resurgence in core urban areas and shifting preference for city life discussed in numerous popular and scholarly reports.  Some have called this shifting pattern of metro growth an “urban inversion” where higher income residents are moving back to more urban areas after a half century of flight to suburban communities.</p>
        <p> It is unclear if the revival and rapid population growth in core urban areas is a growing trend in most Texas metros. However, robust growth in urban areas may increase the risk that residents of vulnerable neighborhoods will be displaced by the influx of new residents and increasing housing costs. </p>
        <p>We attempt to measure the risk that residents in urban census tracts might face displacement (or gentrification pressures) in urban areas across the 25 Texas metros. To conduct this analysis we analyzed patterns of demographic and housing cost change over the 2000-2018 period.</p>

        <h3>Demographic Change</h3>
        <p>Beginning with the vulnerability index for census tracts profiled above, we first looked at patters of socio demographic change between 2000 and 2018. We examined four change variables to assess possible displacement risk in vulnerable census tracts:</p>
        <li>1)  Homeownership – increase in the share of households that own rather than rent;</li>
        <li>2)  Educational Attainment – increase in share of adults 25 or over holding a bachelor’s degree or higher;</li>
        <li>3)  White, Non- Hispanic/Latino Residents – increase in the percent of population that identify as White, Non-Hispanic Latino;</li>
        <li>4)  Income –increase in median family income.</li>
        <p>Census tracts within the 25 MSAs were considered as experiencing socio-demographic change if at least two of the four variables above had significantly higher change values than the average in the given MSA. The significance of the tract difference was estimated with a Z-score. If the Z-score for at least two of the above variables exceeded +0.5 the tract was designated as experiencing significant demographic change over the 2000-2018 period.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Housing Market Change</h3>
        <p>Second, in evaluating displacement risk we examined change in the median value of owner-occupied (or in a few cases median rents) in the census tracts of principle city of an MSA.  To assess housing cost dynamics we used three variables:</p>
        <li>1)  Housing Value 2000 - Median housing value (median gross rent if the housing value is not available) in census tract compared to the median value of the principle city.</li>
        <li>2)  Housing Value 2018 - Median housing value (median gross rent if the housing value is not available) in census tract compared to the median value of the principle city.</li>
        <li>3)  Housing Value Change 2000-2018 – Change in median housing value 2000-2018. If the change in the median housing value is at the top two quintiles of the rate of change in the principle city in the MSA, value change is classified as high/accelerating. </li>
        <p>Putting these three elements together, we developed a classification for all of the census tracts in principle cities in the 25 Texas MSAs that measures displacement (or gentrification) risk. The following table outlines five stages of displacement risk or gentrification pressure.</p>
